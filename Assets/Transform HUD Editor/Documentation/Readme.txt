Transform HUD Editor

This custom editor shows an additional Transform Inspector (position, rotation, scale) directly in the Scene View right next to the selected object. This allows you to conveniently edit an objectâ€™s position, rotation, and scale directly in the Scene View.


INSTALLATION

1. In your project, in the root Assets folder, use or create a new folder named Editor. 

2. Place the TransformHUDEditor.cs script within the Editor folder. So the file structure should look like this:

Assets
   Editor
     TransformHUDEditor.cs
